/*
 * Boyer-Moore-Horspool string search algorithm implementation with streaming support.
 * Most string search algorithm implementations require the entire haystack data to
 * be in memory. In contrast, this implementation allows one to feed the haystack data
 * piece-of-piece in a "streaming" manner.
 *
 * This implementation is optimized for both speed and memory usage.
 * Other than the memory needed for the context structure, it does not perform any
 * additional memory allocations (except for minimal usage of the stack). The context
 * structure, which contains the Boyer-Moore-Horspool occurance table and various
 * state information, is is organized in such a way that it can be allocated with a
 * single memory allocation action, regardless of the length of the needle.
 * Its inner loop also deviates a little bit from the original algorithm: the original
 * algorithm matches data right-to-left, but this implementation first matches the
 * rightmost character, then matches the data left-to-right, thereby incorporating
 * some ideas from "Tuning the Boyer-Moore-Horspool String Searching Algorithm" by
 * Timo Raita, 1992. It uses memcmp() for this left-to-right match which is typically
 * heavily optimized.
 *
 * A few more notes:
 * - This code can be used for searching an arbitrary binary needle in an arbitrary binary
 *   haystack. It is not limited to text.
 * - Boyer-Moore-Horspool works best for long needles. Generally speaking, the longer the
 *   needle the faster the algorithm becomes. Thus, this implementation makes no effort
 *   at being fast at searching single-character needles or even short needles (say,
 *   less than 5 characters). You should just use memchr() and memmem() for that; those
 *   functions are usually heavily optimized (e.g. by using tricks like searching 4 bytes
 *   at the same time by treating data as an array of integers) and will probably be
 *   *much* faster than this code at searching short needles.
 * - You can further tweak this code to favor either memory usage or performance.
 *   See the typedef for sbmh_size_t for more information.
 *
 *
 * == Basic usage
 *
 * 1. Allocate a StreamBMH structure either on the stack (alloca) or on the heap.
 *    It must be at least SBMH_SIZE(needle_len) bytes big.
 *    The maximum supported needle size depends on the definition of sbmh_size_t. See
 *    its typedef for more information.
 *
 * 2. Initialize the structure with sbmh_init(). This structure is now usable for
 *    searching the given needle, and only the given needle.
 *    You must ensure that the StreamBMH structure has at least SBMH_SIZE(needle_len)
 *    bytes of space, otherwise sbmh_init() will overwrite too much memory.
 *    sbmh_init() does NOT make a copy of the needle data.
 *
 * 3. Feed haystack data using sbmh_feed(). You must pass it the same needle that you
 *    passed to sbmh_init(). We do not store a pointer to the needle passed to
 *    sbmh_init() for memory efficiency reasons: the caller already has a pointer
 *    to the needle data so there's no need for us to store it.
 *
 *    sbmh_feed() returns the number of bytes that has been analyzed:
 *
 *    - If the needle has now been found then the position of the last needle character
 *      in the currently fed data will be returned: all data until the end of the needle
 *      has been analyzed, but no more. Additionally, the 'found' field in the context
 *      structure will be set to true.
 *    - If the needle hasn't been found yet, then the size of the currently fed data
 *      will be returned: all fed data has been analyzed.
 *    - If the needle was already found, then any additional call to sbmh_feed()
 *      will cause it to return 0: nothing in the fed data is analyzed.
 *
 * There's no need deinitialize the StreamBMH structure. Just free its memory.
 *
 *
 * == Reuse
 *
 * You can reuse the StreamBMH structure for finding the same needle in a different
 * haystack. Call sbmh_reset() to reset all of its internal state except for the
 * Boyer-Moore-Horspool occurance table which contains needle-specific preparation data.
 * You can then call sbmh_feed() to analyze haystack data.
 *
 * You can reuse an existing StreamBMH structure for finding a *different* needle
 * as well. Call sbmh_init() to re-initialize it for use with a different needle.
 * However you must make sure that the StreamBMH structure is at least
 * SBMH_SIZE(new_needle_len) bytes big.
 *
 *
 * == Recognition of non-needle data
 * 
 * The 'callback' field in the StreamBMH structure can be used for recogning non-needle
 * data. This is especially useful for things like multipart MIME parsers where you're
 * interested in all data except for the needle.
 *
 * This callback is initially set to NULL by sbmh_init(). sbmh_reset() does not set it.
 * When set, sbmh_feed() will call this callback with any data that is determined to not
 * contain the needle. StreamBMH also has a 'user_data' field. You can set it to any
 * value for your own use; this code do not use it at all.
 *
 * The data passed to the callback can be either part of the data in sbmh_feed()'s
 * 'data' argument, or it can be part of the StreamBMH lookbehind buffer. If the latter
 * is the case, then consider the data only valid within the callback: once the
 * callback has finished, this code can do arbitrary things to the lookbehind buffer,
 * so to preserve that data you must make your own copy.

 * sbmh_size_t is a type for representing the needle length. It should be unsigned;
 * it makes no sense for it not to be.
 * By default it's typedef'ed to 'unsigned short', which is a 16-bit integer on most
 * platforms, allowing us to support needles up to about 64 KB. This ough to be enough
 * for most people. In the odd situation that you're dealing with extremely large
 * needles, you can typedef this to 'unsigned int' or even 'unsigned long long'.
 *
 * Its typedef slightly affects performance. Benchmarks on OS X Snow Leopard (x86_64)
 * have shown that typedeffing this to size_t (64-bit integer) makes the benchmark
 * 4-8% faster at the cost of 4 times more memory usage per StreamBMH structure.
 * Consider changing the typedef depending on your needs.
